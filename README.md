# detnsw-autologin-macos
A version of my detnsw-autologin app made for macos.\
At the moment, the app only works as an alternative front-end to the login page, and does not launch on startup or save credentials yet.\
I've sort of abandoned this project as I can't figure out how to do the things stated in the to-do list, and I've open-sourced it if anyone wants to fix the issues.

## To-do
  - Make the "launch on startup" checkbox work
  - Save the login credentials to a folder in ~/Library (or somewhere else)
